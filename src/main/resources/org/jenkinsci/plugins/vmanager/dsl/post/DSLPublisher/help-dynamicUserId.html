  In case of a need in dynamically selecting the user name per job, the pre-job should place into the workspace directory a file with single line that contains the userid to be used.</br>
  The file name should be: ${BUILD_NUMBER}.${BUILD_ID}.user.input"</br>
  The job will pick the userid which is in the file, and connect to vAPI using this userid and the vAPI secret key.
