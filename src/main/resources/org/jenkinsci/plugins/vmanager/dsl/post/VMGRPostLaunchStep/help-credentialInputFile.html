  Supported only from 16.1 and above.</br>
  Verisium Manager can execute jobs in one of two modes:<br/>
  <li> Same user permissions (the account permission where the Verisium Manager server is installed) for all jobs launched by the vAPI/Jenkins. </li>
  <li> Use the Linux account permissions of the actual user who is doing the launch operation.</li></br>
  
  Default (unchecked above) is for the Verisium Manager to launch job by using the account permissions where the server is installed.</br>
  When this box is checked, user can choose between using the same credentials used within the authentication section above, or supply a file with user/password in plain text containing only two lines:</br>
  <strong>
  username</br>
  password</br>
  </strong>
  </br>
  For this (dynamic user/password), a pre-job should place any file into its working directory, and supply the full path to it.</br>
  In case this field is empty, The file name need to be: ${BUILD_NUMBER}.${BUILD_ID}.credential.input, and should be place in the working directory of the current running build.</br>
  Please fill this field only in case you want to hard code the input file name, to be consist across all builds.
